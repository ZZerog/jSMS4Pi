jSMS4Pi

	jSMS4Pi is simple Java library which provides SMS API for USB 3G modems (3G dongles) or other serial port (RS232) modems. 
	It provides abstraction for sent / received sms and other features. Communication with modem is done through AT commands. 
	jSMS4Pi is ideal for  small stand alone computers (as RaspberryPI) without internet connections. If you want to send a SMS 
	through internet try any of Bulksms service.


* How it works

	USB 3G modem creates a virtual serial port after connecting to the computer. jSMS4Pi sends AT commands through serial port to the modem and reads the response.
  


* Supported modems

	jSMS4Pi is using JSSC as the serial port library and supports Win32(Win98-Win8), Win64, Linux(x86, x86-64, ARM), 
	Solaris(x86, x86-64), Mac OS X 10.5 and higher(x86, x86-64, PPC, PPC64) See JSSC {{{https://github.com/scream3r/java-simple-serial-connector}homepage}}. So far it is only tested 
	for Linux OS (Debian) and on Raspberry Pi (Raspbian).


* Supported OS

	jSMS4Pi  should support all modems which use (virtual) serial port (USB 3G modems, real serial port modems, cell phones, etc.). 
	Exceptions are modems that implement incomplete AT command or do not comply with specifications. The set of tested devices will 
	be periodically updated. For more information see section: {{{./modems.html}Supported Modems}} 
	
* Basic Features

	* Send / Receive text message

	* Inbound calls detection

	* Get manufacturing information and the IMEI

	* Tracking BTS cells
